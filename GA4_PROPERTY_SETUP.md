# GA4 Property Setup - You Already Have One! 🎉

## Good News!

If you have:
- ✅ **Measurement ID:** G-LFQ0BL4777
- ✅ **Stream ID:** 13040771317

**You already have a GA4 property set up!** The Measurement ID proves it.

## What You Need: Property ID

The Property ID is a number (like `123456789`) that identifies your property. Here's how to find it:

### Step 1: Access Your GA4 Property

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Make sure you're viewing the correct property (the one with Measurement ID G-LFQ0BL4777)

### Step 2: Find Property ID

**Method A: From Admin Panel**
1. Click **Admin** (gear icon, bottom left)
2. In the **Property** column (middle column), click **"Property Settings"**
3. At the top, you'll see **"Property ID"** - it's a number like `123456789`
4. Copy that number

**Method B: From URL**
1. When you're in Google Analytics, look at the browser URL
2. It might look like: `https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/p123456789/...`
3. The number after `/p` is your Property ID

**Method C: From Data Stream**
1. Go to **Admin** → **Data Streams**
2. Click on your stream (the one with Stream ID 13040771317)
3. Look for **"Property ID"** in the stream details
